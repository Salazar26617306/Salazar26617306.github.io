## About Roberto Calvi

Roberto is an astute writer who shares my passion for exploring innovations in AI, VR, crypto, and other emerging tech domains. We've spent many evenings engaged in thought-provoking discussions and friendly debates on everything from neural networks to blockchain governance.

Though our backgrounds differ, our curiosity binds us in the joint quest for understanding the technologies reshaping society. I'm grateful that Roberto provides a digital oasis to share ideas and spread our cumulative knowledge.

I admire his rational, insightful perspectives on our shared interests. I believe you'll find his writings to be an excellent accompaniment to the content you'll eventually find here. Be sure to peruse his ever-growing library of posts spanning machine learning, philosophy, economics, and more.

While my site is getting started, you can explore some great perspectives on technology and futurism from my friend Roberto Calvi over on [his Medium page][rcalvi].
